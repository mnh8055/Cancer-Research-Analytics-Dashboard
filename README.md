# Cancer-Research-Analytics-Dashboard
 This project presents an interactive Cancer Research Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze and compare tumor characteristics based on diagnostic outcomes. Using structured cancer research data, the dashboard provides a clear comparison between Benign (B) and Malignant (M) cases through key metrics and visual analytics.
## Project Objectives
-Analyze tumor characteristics across diagnostic categories
-Compare benign and malignant cases using statistical measures
-Identify patterns and correlations among tumor features
-Visualize key metrics through interactive dashboards
-Support data-driven insights for medical research and analytics


## Dataset used
-<a href="https://github.com/mnh8055/Cancer-Research-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/Cancer_Data.csv">Dataset </a></n>

## Questions (KPIs)
-What is the distribution of benign vs malignant cases?
-How do mean tumor features differ by diagnosis?
-Which tumor attributes are most prominent in malignant cases?
-What is the relationship between area mean and perimeter mean?
-How do concavity and smoothness vary across diagnoses?
-What are the average values of key tumor measurements?
-Which features show the strongest diagnostic separation?

## Project Insights
-Malignant tumors show higher mean values for radius, area, perimeter, and concavity
-Strong positive correlation exists between area mean and perimeter mean
-Shape-related features provide clear diagnostic separation
-Benign tumors generally exhibit lower variability and smoother profiles
-Quantitative tumor measurements play a critical role in diagnosis

## Final Conclusion
The Cancer Research Analytics Dashboard demonstrates how structured medical data can be transformed into actionable insights through visualization. The analysis highlights that size-related and shape-related tumor features are key indicators of malignancy.

This project showcases strong skills in data analysis, visualization, and analytical storytelling, making it suitable for healthcare analytics portfolios, research demonstrations, and business intelligence applications.
